Academic Success Forecasting
Overview
Predict students’ academic outcomes (e.g., dropout, progress, graduation) using machine learning models based on demographic, socioeconomic, and educational features. Ideal for early identification of at‑risk students to enable timely interventions. Modeled after similar systems

Features
Multi‑class classification: dropout, enrolled, graduate

Input features: gender, ethnicity, parental education, socioeconomic indicators, semester grades, etc.

Model comparison: evaluates algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)

Extensible to new data and additional features

Dataset
Based on the Kaggle U.S. “Students Performance in Exams” dataset (~1,000 students, 8–30+ features):

Gender, ethnicity, parental level of education

Lunch status

Test preparation completion

First and second semester scores (math, reading, writing)

Tech Stack
Python (3.8+)

Data handling: Pandas, NumPy

Modeling: scikit-learn, optionally XGBoost or CatBoost

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

App integration: Flask or FastAPI for REST or web interfaces

Packaging/deployment: Docker (optional)

Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Academic-Success-Forecasting.git
cd Academic-Success-Forecasting
2. Set up Virtual Environment
bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

pip install -r requirements.txt
(Alternatively, use conda or pipenv)

3. Data Preparation
Place students_performance.csv in a data/ folder.

Adjust data loading paths in src/data_preprocessing.py.

4. Training the Model
bash
Copy
Edit
python src/train.py
Logs model performance (accuracy, ROC-AUC, confusion matrix). You can compare classifiers and adjust hyperparameters here.

5. Run Prediction API
bash
Copy
Edit
python src/app.py
Exposes a REST endpoint (e.g., /predict).

Input: JSON features; Output: predicted class + probabilities
